## Overview

Flake is an Auto-Scaling Cluster Manager designed specifically for Discord.py, the popular Python library for creating Discord bots. It's built to help you efficiently manage your Discord bot instances, making it easier to handle fluctuating workloads and ensure your bot runs smoothly even during periods of high demand.

With Flake, you can automatically scale the number of bot instances up or down based on various metrics, such as server load, message processing speed, or custom triggers you define. This helps you save resources and costs when the demand for your bot fluctuates.

## Features

- Flake can automatically adjust the number of bot instances to match the current demand, ensuring efficient resource utilization.

- Designed to work seamlessly with Discord.py.

- Automatically restarts clusters that died with a non-zero exit status

- Will turn off if all clusters close with exit code 0
